# Dynamic Web Page Project

This project creates a dynamic and interactive multi-section landing page. The page features a navigation bar that is automatically built based on the sections present in the HTML. As the user scrolls, the navigation highlights the section currently in the viewport, and clicking a navigation link provides a smooth scroll to the corresponding section. Additionally, the page includes a comment section with a form for users to submit feedback, which is then displayed on the page.

## Skills Demonstrated

* **HTML5:** 
* **CSS3:** 
* JavaScript (ES6+):
  * **DOM Manipulation:** [Selecting, creating, and modifying HTML elements dynamically (e.g., building the navigation bar, adding comments).]
  * **Event Handling:** [Attaching event listeners to respond to user interactions (e.g., clicks on navigation links, form submission, page scrolling).]
  * **Working with Element Properties:** [Using methods like getBoundingClientRect() to determine element positions and scrollIntoView() for smooth scrolling.]
  * **Basic Form Handling & Validation:** [Capturing form input, performing simple validation checks, and preventing default form submission.]
  * **Iterating over Collections:** Using methods like `forEach` to loop through NodeLists of elements.
  * **`DOMContentLoaded` Event:** Ensuring script execution waits for the full HTML document to be loaded and parsed.
